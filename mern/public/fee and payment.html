            Welcome to www.Go Pharma. com ("Go Pharma.com", "Go Pharma", "Website",
            "Pharmacy", or "we"). This Website/App is managed and operated by
            Reliance Retail Limited whose registered office is in Mumbai, India.

        </div>

        <div class="box2">
          <p>
            Reliance Retail Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of
            India, having its registered address at 3rd Floor, Court House,
            Lokmanya Tilak Marg, Dhobi Talao, Mumbai – 400002 (“Reliance”, “we”,
            “us” or “our”), manages and operates an online marketplace at
            www.Go Pharma.com and a mobile application under the brand name
            Go Pharma (collectively referred to as the “Platform”) which
            facilitates different vendors to sell their Products and/or Services
            and enabling different buyers to purchase the Products and/or
            Services offered by the vendors to the users of the Platform (“User”
            or “Users” or “you”).
          </p>
          <h3>WHAT ARE THE FEES AND PAYMENTS POLICY?</h3>
          <p>
            This Fees and Payments Policy (“FPP Policy”), together with the
            Terms and Conditions [accessible at
            https://www.Go Pharma.com/terms-and-conditions] describes Reliance’s
            accepted payment methods, and Reliance’s policies and procedures in
            relation to acceptance of fees and payments towards the services
            offered through the Platform. Reliance’s primary object is to ensure
            that the Platform is user friendly and equipped with reasonably
            expected security infrastructure to protect any financial
            information which may be shared by User.
          </p>
          <p>
            User(s) are required to peruse and understand the terms of this FPP
            Policy. If you do not agree to the terms contained in this FPP
            Policy, you are advised not to accept the Terms of Use and this FPP
            Policy and may forthwith leave and stop using the Platform. The
            terms contained in this FPP Policy shall be accepted without
            modification and also, by using, browsing, accessing, or purchasing
            on the Platform, you agree to be bound by the terms contained
            herein.
          </p>
          <h3>FEES AND PAYMENT OPTIONS</h3>
          <p>
            1. Reliance does not levy any fee for browsing the Platform.
            Reliance may in future, consider levying fees on the User for using
            the Platform as a whole, or for use of certain features of the
            Platform. In such an event, you agree to pay any such fees, as
            applicable. Reliance does not covenant or guarantee providing you
            with a notice prior to enforcing such a levy of fees. Your continued
            usage of the Platform after such change in the fees will be
            considered to be your acceptance of such changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. In order to ensure User convenience, Reliance offers multiple
            payment options to User. Reliance without prior notice to User,
            reserves the right to add or delete payment options from the ones
            listed below:
          </p>
          <p>
            .payment through net banking facilities; <br />
            . payment through select credit cards;<br />
            .payment through select debit cards;<br />
            . payment through store credit;<br />
            .payments through cash on delivery;<br />
            . payments through prepaid payment instruments and electronic
            wallets;<br />
            Any other payment option as may be provided by Reliance from time to
            time. The payment options referred to above shall hereinafter
            collectively be referred to as “Payment Options”. While reasonable
            endeavours are made to offer the Payment Options through varied
            banking channels, presently, Reliance accepts payments only from
            major select banking avenues. Reliance does not accept payments made
            through international debit/credit cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. It is expressly clarified that accepting a User’s payment through
            the Payment Options is solely at Reliance’s discretion. Reliance
            reserves the right to reject payment from a User through the Payment
            Options for any reason whatsoever. In order to further validate a
            User’s transaction, Reliance may request the User to submit a copy
            of the User’s photo identity proof (such as the User’s PAN card),
            failing which, Reliance reserves the right to reject a User’s
            payment made through the Payment Options.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. While using the Payment Options, User agrees to provide correct,
            complete and accurate financial information such as credit/debit
            card details or prepaid payment instrument account details which may
            be stored by Reliance’s third party payment gateway provider.
            User(s) shall not use a credit/debit card or prepaid instrument
            which is not lawfully owned by him/her or which the User has not
            been lawfully authorised to use. The User shall solely be
            responsible for the security and confidentiality of his/her
            financial information. Reliance disclaims all liabilities that may
            arise as a consequence of any unauthorised use of the User’s
            financial information and/or identity, including, details relating
            the Payment Options.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Reliance shall not be held responsible and shall not assume any
            liability in respect of any loss or damage suffered by a User owing
            to: <br />
            .lack of authorisation for any transaction, including such
            transactions carried out on gift cards and vouchers issued to
            User(s) as a part of Reliance’s promotions. <br />
            .exceeding of the credit/debit limit mutually agreed between the
            User and the issuing bank.<br />
            . any payment issue arising out of technical glitches occurring
            during a transaction.<br />
            .Transactions being declined for reasons beyond Reliance’s control
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Reliance reserves the right to impose limits on the number of
            transactions a User may undertake over the Platform. Should the User
            exceed such transaction limits imposed by Reliance, Reliance
            reserves the right to refuse to process such transactions. Reliance
            may refuse to process transactions emanating from User(s) who have
            suspicious or questionable transaction history on the Platform.
            Should Reliance be dissatisfied with the credibility of a User or
            the genuineness of a transaction carried out on the Platform,
            Reliance shall have the right to reject such transactions. Reliance
            may also choose to delay the dispatch of Products purchased by such
            User or cancel the entire purchase at its sole discretion. The User
            agrees that Reliance shall not be liable for any damage, interests
            or claims resulting from Reliance’s decision to not process a
            transaction or delay in the processing of a transaction on account
            of a User’s suspicious activity on the Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. All the Products listed on the Platform are inclusive of all
            applicable taxes. You will be responsible for payment of all
            fees/costs/charges associated with the purchase of Products from us
            and you agree to bear any and all applicable taxes including but not
            limited to VAT/CST, service tax, GST, duties and cesses etc. Despite
            Reliance’s best efforts, there may be instances of mispricing of
            Products on the Platform during or after the process of purchase of
            Products has been carried out by the User. While thorough processes
            of verification is carried out prior to the publication of Product
            prices on the Platform, errors and discrepancies arising out of
            technical glitches and time lags are unavoidable. For avoidance of
            doubt, Reliance’s curative actions that will arise in the event of a
            price difference arising on the actual maximum retail price of a
            Products against the price published on the Platform is set out
            below:
            <li>
              If the maximum retail price of the Products delivered to the User
              is lower than the price published on the Platform, the User shall,
              within 2 (two) days from the time when he/she received the
              Products, intimate us at cs@Go Pharma.com / 7200712345 in each case
              resulting in an acknowledgment. Upon Reliance being satisfied of
              the User’s claim, the difference amount in the purchase price
              against the maximum retail price shall be refunded as store credit
              or transferred to the User’s bank account within 10 (ten) to 12
              (twelve) working days from the date of receiving the written
              request from the User.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the maximum retail price of the Products listed on the Platform
              is higher than what has been published and if Reliance is not
              providing an offer or discount on such Products, Reliance shall
              have the right to reserve the despatch of the purchased Products
              until the error on the Platform have been rectified and the User
              pays the difference amount. If the User refuses to pay the
              difference amount, the User is entitled to seek a cancellation and
              the amount paid by the User shall be refunded as store credit or
              transferred into the User’s bank account within 10 (ten) working
              days by Reliance.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to process such refunds, the User will be required to
              send an email to us at cs@Go Pharma.com or call us at7200712345.
              Thereafter, the User will receive a refund if the initial mode of
              payment for the order was ‘cash on delivery’ on users account
              through NEFT. If the initial mode of payment for the order was
              through a payment option other than the ‘cash on delivery’ option,
              we may transfer the refund to the User’s source account, which was
              used to make the initial payment.
            </li>
          </p>

          <p>
            8. To enable User to make payments for purchasing Products on the
            Platform, in addition to this FPP Policy, the terms and conditions
            of the User’s bank, applicable financial institution and/or card
            issuing association may be applicable. The User’s bank, financial
            institution or card issuing association may decline or prevent the
            User from making electronic payments for buying the Products on the
            Platform and Reliance does not control the same and hence, shall not
            be at any point in time be held liable.
          </p>
          <p>
            9. Reliance may, from time to time contract with third party payment
            service providers including banks, to open nodal bank accounts under
            applicable Indian laws. This will be done to facilitate the payments
            between User(s) and other third parties, apart from Reliance. These
            third parties may include other service providers including payment
            aggregators, prepaid instrument providers, courier and logistic
            service providers etc. Upon successful delivery of the products
            purchased by you through the Platform, Reliance shall initiate
            payments to third party service providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            10. If it is brought to the User’s notice that a charge has been
            created on his/her payment instrument(s) for purchase of Products on
            the Platform and the User is not aware of such purchase on the
            Platform, the User is first, required to verify if his/her family
            members, friends or business colleagues were authorised to carry out
            the purchase of Products on the Platform. If, despite this, the User
            continues to be unable to identify the charge created on his/her
            payment instrument(s) for purchase of Products on the Platform, the
            User may report such unauthorised purchase to us within 2 (two) days
            from the date on which the unauthorised purchase was carried out on
            the Platform in order to enable Reliance initiate investigations.
          </p>
          <p>
            11. If the User carries out a purchase on the Platform and the
            payment in lieu thereof has been invalidated, Reliance reserves the
            right to retrieve the invalidated payment (“Invalidated Payment”)
            from the User’s store credit. Should the User have insufficient
            store credit in order to facilitate such redemption of the
            invalidated payment, the User shall within 2 (two) to 4 (four)
            working days from the date of receiving a written notice from
            Reliance, remit the Invalidated Payment into Reliance’s bank
            account, details of which shall be set out in the notice. If the
            User fails to remit the Invalidated Payment into Reliance’s bank
            account despite having received the notice, Reliance shall be
            entitled to initiate civil and/or criminal legal action against the
            defaulting User at his/her cost and peril.
          </p>
          <p>
            12. The ‘cash on delivery’ payment option allows Users to make a
            cash-only payment to our delivery executive or logistic partner at
            the time of delivery of the purchased Products to the User.
            Presently, we offer a maximum order value of INR 10,000 (Indian
            Rupees Ten Thousand) under the cash on delivery payment option.
            Reliance reserves the right not to provide the option of cash on
            delivery payment for certain Products (these could be Products
            specified by Reliance or Products with value exceeding a specified
            amount) or locations. User(s) are required to peruse and accept the
            terms set out under the Return Refund and Cancellation Policy which
            sets out the terms of refunds for transactions carried out using the
            cash on delivery payment option.
          </p>
          <p>
            13. Store Credit: If a User cancels an order for which payment has
            already been made to Reliance, the User shall have an option to
            convert the amount paid towards the order into store credit. In
            addition, any and all refunds with respect to Products purchased
            through the ‘cash on delivery’ payment option will be transferred as
            store credit into the User’s store credit account and in the event
            of the User expressing his/her intention to deactivate his/her
            account then such unused Store Credit will be transferred to the
            source account. Reliance may at its sole discretion, grant store
            credit to users. The store credits can be used by the user for
            future purchases only on the Platform. In the eventuality of a User
            wishing to deactivate his/her account with Reliance, the User agrees
            that all store credit granted by Reliance available on the User’s
            store credit account, if any, will automatically stand forfeited,
            and Reliance will not be required to process any refunds in any
            manner whatsoever. The User therefore agrees to use and exhaust any
            existing store credit prior to requesting for a deactivation of
            his/her account on the Platform. Notwithstanding anything to the
            contrary, any refund of store credit to the User will be at the sole
            discretion of Reliance. If Reliance suspects any fraudulent
            activities, Reliance reserves its right to hold back transfer of any
            store credits to User.
