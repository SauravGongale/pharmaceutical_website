            collected from you to our trusted third party service providers who
            assist us in order to facilitate the provision of services and
            purchase of Products on the Platform. For instance, we may share
            your information with third party payment gateway providers to
            process transactions on the Platform. By using the Platform, you
            consent to any such disclosure of your information with third party
            service providers. We ensure that such third party service providers
            are bound by reasonable confidentiality obligations and/or use,
            maintain and follow generally accepted industry and security
            standards with respect to such information.

            4.2 We may also disclose your information when such disclosure is
            requisitioned under any law or judicial decree or when we, in our

            the rights of other Users, to prevent harm to persons or property,
            to fight fraud and credit risk.

            party to which we transfer or sell our assets will have appropriate

            those described in this Privacy Policy, to handle your Personal
            Information. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such
            transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information

            Financial Information collected from you by such third party payment
            gateway providers will be used only for billing and payment
            processes. The Financial Information collected from you is
            transacted through secure digital platforms of approved payment
            gateways, which are under encryption, thereby complying with
            reasonably expected technology standards. The verification of the
            Financial Information shall be accomplished only by you through a
            process of authentication in which we shall have no role to play and
            hence, we shall bear no liability in relation to the same. We shall
            neither be liable nor responsible for any actions or inactions of
            the third party payment gateway providers or any breach of
            conditions, representations and warranties given by them. We shall
            also not be obligated to mediate or resolve any dispute or
            disagreement between you and such third party payment service
            providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.5 While we make best efforts to ensure that your information
            including Personal Information, Financial Information and Sensitive
            Personal Information or Data is duly protected by undertaking
            security measures prescribed under applicable laws, you are strongly
            advised to exercise reasonable discretion while providing Personal
            Information or Financial Information while using the services given
            that the Internet is susceptible to security breaches

            4.6 Your information may also be transferred, stored or processed in

            Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to transfer your information
            outside of your country. By using the (Platform, you consent to such
            transfer of your information outside of your country and also within
            our affiliates, subsidiaries and partners whose personnel and
            subcontractors, provided they have agreed to ensure the same level
            of data protection as prescribed under this Privacy Policy and the
            data protection laws of India. The information may be transferred in
            the event it is necessary for the performance of the services,
            operation of the Platform and provision of Products as agreed upon
            between us and the third party.
          </p>
